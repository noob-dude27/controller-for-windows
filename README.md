    with keyboard shortcuts for easier navigation and use. You can also type using an on-screen keyboard.

# How to install and run
    To install, simply download this repository. To run this project, simply open app.py and you will be
    greeted with a widget that says: 'Controller for windows'

# How to use
    app.py has already been preconfigured and the controls mapped to run properly. If you're not satisified
    or prefer different settings, you can change them. Here are the settings and their meanings:

    Controllers tab:
    * Enable/Disable Controller: Self-explanatory
    * Cursor Speed: The speed of the cursor when moving in the screen
    * Scroll Speed: The speed of the controller's scroll.
    * Repeat Button Events: Disabling this, you will have to keep tapping to do specific actions
    * Delay per Movement: An initial delay that happens everytime a continous serie of events happen (Useless when Repeat Button events are off)
    * Repeat speed: A continous delay that happens everytim a continous serie of events happen (also useless when Repeat Button events are off)
    * Launch Keyboard Widget: Launches an on-screen keyboard that you can type with your controller

    Mapping tab:
    * Selected Preset: There are 3 presets. The first one is the default and cannot be mapped except for Preset 2 and 3. To map a key to a button, select the control and then its new keybind, and then press "Set Keybind" to save the new bind. To use a preset, just click "Use Preset" and the controller mapping will be set to the new preset.
